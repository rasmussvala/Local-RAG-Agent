# Local-RAG-Agent

A local RAG agent that you can add documents to and ask questions about. Very much still a work in progress.

## Notes to self

- Currently pytorch is installed without cuda support, it's very slow, maybe uninstall, install with cuda and make it only usable for cuda sopported gpus
- create a command "clear" to restart chat
